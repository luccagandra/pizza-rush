# PIZZA RUSH üçï

Being a waitress is hard. Not being inconvenient and at the same time serve the largest amount of people is an extremely underestimated skill. So, the question is, what is the best strategy and trajectory that maximizes tables served and minimize the length of the trajectory made in the restaurant? This is a project made for the class of Introduction to Optimization from professor Amit Bhaya - UFRJ. Notice that this problem can be applied to real world logistics, where tables, waitresses and pizzas can be switched to clients, trucks and products, respectively.
